        My dearest Sabhyata,<br>
        Good morning, wifey—or maybe I should say good night? The clock has just struck 00:00, which means the day has finally arrived! Today is not just any ordinary day—it’s the birthday of the most beautiful, cutest, and brightest star in my life. Yes, I’m talking about you, you adorable goof! It’s your birthday, and you are truly the person who lights up my world like nobody else ever could. This is your seventh birthday, but it’s the first time I get to celebrate it with you, and that makes it extra special for me. So, I thought to myself ,why not make it a grand celebration? That’s why I’ve gone all out this time and prepared a lot of surprises and gifts just for you, hoping to see that precious smile on your face.
        But let’s be honest ,no matter how many gifts I give, it will never feel like enough because you deserve the world and more! My heart just wants to shower you with endless love and presents. Giving you things, writing you letters, and crafting thoughtful surprises ,that’s my love language. I find so much joy in expressing how much I cherish you through these little acts. This particular gift took a great deal of time and effort to create, but every second was worth it because it’s for you. I want all your birthdays to feel extra special, not just this one. I look forward to making each of your birthdays in the future even more memorable, so you always know how much you mean to me.
        Call me possessive if you must, but I can’t help wanting to make you feel cherished and loved every single day, especially today. You’re not just my girlfriend—you’re my wifey, my best friend, and my lucky charm. Out of the 8 billion people in this world, I truly believe I’ve found the best, most wonderful girl. Your beauty is unmatched, and your voice , ah, it’s like music to my ears; kisses to the chef for that! Your sweetness, your laughter, and your warmth make my world so much brighter. I can’t wait to see what this year brings for you and for us together. Happy birthday, my love! Here’s to making countless more memories, sharing more laughter, and celebrating many more birthdays side by side.
        Well no one likes long boring letters on their birthday , so lets leave it here.  Happy birthday, make this day and the countless before you bring you nothing but joy , food and happiness.
        And well please don’t leave me , love you smm can’t wait for the day , when I get to organise your birthday on a trip with both of our families… and record a video of you cutting the cake and opening the presents I prepared but getting shocked on each one.
        And see the brightest smile on your face.
        From , a boy who loves you  - Aniket.
